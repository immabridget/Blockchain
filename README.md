# Blockchain
Blockchain is a digitally distributed, decentralized, public ledger that exists across a network.
in this file we implement AES encryption using python.
We first installinstall the pycrypto library, which can be done via pip
we import base64  which is a module that provides functions for encoding binary data to printable ASCII characters and decoding such encodings back to binary data.
we import Hashlib which implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms.
lastly we import the AES a symmetric block cipher.
we now write the functions for encryption and decryption.
